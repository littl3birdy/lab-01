# lab-01: SMACSS and responsive web design

This was an assignment in my intermediate JS course.  We learned the basics of SMACSS styling principles with CSS.

## Feature Tasks: (Quoted directly from CodeFellows 301 lab-01 assignment requirements)

-Use SMACSS-style modularity to organize your CSS.

-Style the page using float-based layout to reflect the comp images provided as closely as possible. The only text you should have in each box is the identifying letter, which should be centered horizontally and vertically.

-For the desktop view, the content should be inside of a channel that is a maximum of 960 pixels wide and is centered on wider screen sizes.

-Each box should have a unique background color in mobile view and in desktop view. We are not working with jQuery events yet, so these changes should be observed when the screen size changes and the page is refreshed.
